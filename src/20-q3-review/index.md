We'll be focusing on our third quarter work, and our roadmaps for the next quarter, in the next couple of weekly calls. You're invited to join in!

As you may know, every week on Monday we have a series of calls about the state of the IPFS project. These calles are announced in an issue in [ipfs/pm](https://github.com/ipfs/pm), and on the [IRC #ipfs channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23ipfs) when they happen. Normally, we have an All Hands call, where we discuss top-level issues, and then thirty minute calls specific to js-ipfs, libp2p, go-ipfs, and occasionally other topcis which need to be talked about, like IPLD, apps on IPFS, orbit, and the newsletter and blog.

For the next couple of weeks, instead of going through our routine of covering work done, and looking at work to do, we're going to have a specific goal for these calls; to go over all of the work we've done since the IPFS Workshop in Lisbon at the end of July, and to cover some of the work we plan to do in the next few months. In mid-October all of the project heads will be meeting in person to lay out our finalized roadmap for our fourth quarter.

If you're interested in seeing how IPFS has grown over the last few months, we especially encourage you to swing by the IRC channel or to keep an eye on ipfs/pm to wait for the sprint issues. If you have some thing you want to see in Q4, this will also be the place to voice those desires: we want to make sure the community is heard and involved, as much as possible.

If you'd like to weigh in on the process for the next two weeks, check out [this issue](https://github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/202) and let us know!
